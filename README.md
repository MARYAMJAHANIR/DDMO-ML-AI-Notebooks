# Vector-Borne Disease Classification Project

## Project Description

In this project, we developed and implemented robust machine learning models for the accurate classification of vector-borne diseases. We utilized a tabular dataset containing diverse features to achieve this goal.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements

- **Data Preprocessing and Analysis:** Conducted extensive data preprocessing, analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.

- **Feature Engineering:** Applied advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance and extract valuable information from the dataset.

- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Employed the Support Vector Machine  (SVC) and Neural Network (NN) classifier as the primary machine learning algorithm for disease classification.

- **Model Training and Optimization:** Conducted rigorous model training, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using the mean average precision at k (MAP@K) metric, showcasing the ability to assess the model's predictive accuracy.

- **Generalization:** Demonstrated the capacity to build models that generalize effectively to unseen data.

- **Kaggle Competition:** Achieved competitive results in the Kaggle competition by consistently ranking among the top participants.

- **Collaboration:** Collaborated with fellow data scientists, actively participating in forums and discussions, and contributing to the broader data science community.

- **Prediction:** Successfully applied the trained SVC model to predict the top three likely vector-borne diseases on an unseen dataset.
